Caudium support for Fins applications

Installation Instructions

1. copy fins_http.pike to your caudium/server/protocols directory.
2. copy fins_application.pike to your caudium/local/modules directory.
3. shutdown caudium, if started already.
4. start caudium with the following option added to start-caudium:
    start-caudium -M/path/to/Fins/lib

   where /path/to/Fins/lib is the path to your Fins lib directory.
5. start Caudium

To add a fins application to a virtual server:

1. Change the protocol for the virtual server's listen port from http 
  to fins_http. If you're using IP-less virtual hosting, this would be 
  the virtual server handling the requests.
2. Add the Fins Application module to your virtual server.
3. Set the value of the Fins Application Framework Directory path to 
  the Fins directory.
4. Provide the name of the application and configuration.
