//! This relationship is a variation of the InverseForeignKeyReference, that is the "one" in one-to-many,
//! where the gathered records are presented as a mapping or array. The records are indexed using the values of 
//! a field on the related object. 
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! A type "user" has a primary key field id. A type "preference" has a foreign key field "user_id" that 
//! indicates the user for which that preference is associated. The definition of the "preference" type 
//! would contain a reference for the foreign key (a @[Fins.Model.ForeignKeyRelationship]) whereas the
//! "user" object definition would contain the inverse relationship (@[Fins.Model.InverseForeignKeyRelationship])
//! which could be used to find all "preference" objects owned by that user.
//! 
//! This type of reference adds a twist to this idea: if the "preference" object had some field that identified the 
//! particular preference for this user, perhaps "preference_name", we could use this (@[MappedForeignKeyReference]) relationship type to 
//! organize the user's preferences in a mapping by name, saving us from having to perform an additional find operation:
//!
//! someuser["preferences"]["default_folder"]
